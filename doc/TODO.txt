- add command which creates a histogram of extensions of files in a folder.
- get ridd of click and use pytconf.
- make setup.py be made out of a template.
- add a utility to remove non ascii characters from a file (with a report
	about how many characters were removed, etc).
	make it run on compressed files also
	and return them to their compressed state.
- add a utility to max the screen resolution (of any screen which is active).
- add a tool to show progress by pointing to a FILE and not a PROCESS NAME or PID.
	If you point to a file then something like fuser(1) should be called
	on the file, and if there is just one process holding the file open
	then show the progress on that file.
